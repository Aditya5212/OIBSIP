# Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship

Welcome to the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship! This repository contains information about the internship program, including tasks, guidelines, and resources to help you succeed in your data science journey.

## Overview

This internship program provides an opportunity for aspiring data scientists to work on real-world projects and gain hands-on experience in the field of data science.

### Internship Duration
- Start Date: 10 December 2023
- End Date: 15 January 2024 

### Internship Location
This is a remote internship, allowing you to work from anywhere with an internet connection.

## Internship Tasks

### Task 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
- Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
  measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
  their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
  measurements of the iris species and classify them.


### Task 2: UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON
- Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
  who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp
  increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate
  can be a good data science project.

### Task 3: CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
- The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car,
  features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price
  prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn
  how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.

### Task 4: EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
- We’ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email
  that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic
  messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.
- In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to
  train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. Let’s get
  started!


### Task 5: SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
- Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors
  such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
  advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.
- Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict
  their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their
  product. So let’s start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (version 3.11)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Additional libraries- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciKit-Learn, Seaborn,etc.


##Happy coding!
